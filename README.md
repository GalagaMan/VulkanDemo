# VulkanDemo
That's where ye will contemplate my exhaustive CG and CXX skills

In order to be compiled project does require following external libraries: 
glfw compiled static libraries(.lib) and header files,
vulkan 1.2.xxx.x static libraries and header files,

Create a folder named "Dependencies" in root directory(.sln directory), thereafter create folders "glfw-3.3.6" and "Vulkan 1.2.198.1".
Paste to glfw folder "include" and "lib-vc2022" directories acquired via downloading glfw from <a href="https://www.glfw.org/download">here</a>.
Paste to vulkan folder "Include" and "Lib" directories from VulkanSDK downloaded <a href="https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home">here</a>.

After all that you you should be up and running.
